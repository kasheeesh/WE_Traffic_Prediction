# Road Traffic Prediction using Machine Learning

This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict road traffic on a particular day using historical traffic data. We will be implementing and comparing several machine learning models to achieve this task. The models we plan to use are:

1. Random Forest Regressor
2. Support Vector Regression
3. Gradient Booster Regression
4. XGBoost Regressor

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project consists of historical road traffic data. Each data point includes various features such as time of day, day of week, weather conditions, and past traffic volumes. The target variable is the volume of traffic for a particular day.

## Implementation

Each machine learning model will be implemented using Python and popular libraries such as scikit-learn, XGBoost, and others. We will follow standard practices for data preprocessing, model training, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation.

## Evaluation

The performance of each model will be evaluated using common regression metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared. Additionally, we will visualize the predicted traffic volumes against the actual values to gain insights into model performance.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Explore the dataset and preprocess it as necessary.
4. Train each machine learning model using the provided scripts.
5. Evaluate the performance of each model using the evaluation scripts.
6. Compare the results and analyze the strengths and weaknesses of each model.
